                            Leonardo wears a blue mask and wields two katana. As the most conscientious
                            of the four, he often bears the burden of responsibilty for his brothers,
                            which commonly leads to conflict with Raphael.</p>

                        wears a purple mask and wields a bo staff. Donatellow is perhaps the least
                        violent turtle, preferring to use his knowledge to solve conflicts, but 
                        never hesitates to defend his brothers.</p>

                        relaxed, and often goofy jokester, and known for his love of pizza. 
                        Michelangelo wears an orange mask and wields a pair of nunchucks. He 
                        provides the comic relief, though he still has an adventurous side. The 
                        least mature of the four Turtles, he shows characteristics of a "surfer" type 
                        and is often depicted with a Southern Californian accent.</p>

                        He is physically very strong, has an aggresive nature, and seldom hesitates
                        to throw the first punch. He is often depicted with a very pronounced New York accent. His personality can be fierce and sarcastic, and oftentimes delivers deadpan humor. He is intensely loyal to his brothes and sensei.</p>
