            relaxed, and often goofy jokester, and known for his love of pizza. 
            Michelangelo wears an orange mask and wields a pair of nunchucks. He 
            provides the comic relief, though he still has an adventurous side. The 
            least mature of the four Turtles, he shows characteristics of a "surfer" type 
            and is often depicted with a Southern Californian accent.</span></p>

            He is physically very strong, has an aggresive nature, and seldom hesitates
            to throw the first punch. He is often depicted with a very pronounced New York
            accent. His personality can be fierce and sarcastic, and oftentimes delivers deadpan
            humor. He is intensely loyal to his brothes and sensei.</span></p>
