                        <p class="main-content">The tactical, courageous leader and devoted student of his sensei,
                            Leonardo wears a blue mask and wields two katana. As the most conscientious
                            of the four, he often bears the burden of responsibilty for his brothers,
                            which commonly leads to conflict with Raphael.</p>
            
                        <p class="main-content">Leonardo was named after the Italian polymath, painter, engineer,
                            inventor, writer, anatomist, and sculptor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci" target="_blank" class="blue-text">Leonardo da Vinci.</a></p></div>

                            wears a purple mask and wields a bo staff. Donatellow is perhaps the least
                            violent turtle, preferring to use his knowledge to solve conflicts, but 
                            never hesitates to defend his brothers.</p> 
            
                        <p class="main-content">Donatello is named after the early Renaissance Italian artist and sculptor 
                            from Florence, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donatello" target="_blank" class="purple-text">Donatello.</a></p></div>

                        <p class="main-content">The stereotypical teenager of the team, Michelangelo is a free-spirited,
                            relaxed, and often goofy jokester, and known for his love of pizza. 
                            Michelangelo wears an orange mask and wields a pair of nunchucks. He 
                            provides the comic relief, though he still has an adventurous side. The 
                            least mature of the four Turtles, he shows characteristics of a "surfer" type 
                            and is often depicted with a Southern Californian accent.</p>
            
                        <p class="main-content">He is named after the Renaissance painter, sculptor, architect, poet,
                            and engineer, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo" target="_blank" class="orange-text">Michelangelo.</a></p></div>

                        <p class="main-content">The team's bad boy, Raphael wears a red mask and wields a pair of sai.
                            He is physically very strong, has an aggresive nature, and seldom hesitates
                            to throw the first punch. He is often depicted with a very pronounced New York
                            accent. His personality can be fierce and sarcastic, and oftentimes delivers deadpan
                            humor. He is intensely loyal to his brothes and sensei.</p>
